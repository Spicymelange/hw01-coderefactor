Homework 1- Code Refactor

This was a project to refactor an example of a website.

The goal was to alter the HTML in order to ensure:

1. Semantic HTML elements had a logical structure
2. Image elements had appropriate alt descriptions
3. Heading attributes had appropriate usage and order
4. A concise title

Overview of changes:

Changed <div> tags to <header>, <main>, <aside>, <footer> where appropriate.

Added alt descriptions to images in the <main> and <aside>

Changed the <footer> heading from <h2> to <h4>

as they were redundant.
